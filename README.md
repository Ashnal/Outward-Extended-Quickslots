# Outward-Extended-Quickslots
Partiality mod for Outward that adds 8 new quickslots with custom bindings.
It also adds bindings for the Sit and AlternateIdle emotes.

Uses [Partiality](https://github.com/PartialityModding) and [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony).
Huge thanks to [stimmedcow](https://github.com/stimmedcow/Outward/tree/master/ExtendedHotbar) for his quickslot creation code, which this mod would not be possible without. A number of changes were necessary to turn it into a mod, but much of the research and code is his.
